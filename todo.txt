# Set up JavaScript constants provider
    - Each page can have its own data file
    - The data file is a Template with just a javascript table in it 
        (Within script tags)
    - In the template for the page which needs the file, 
        add the name of the data table inside curly brackets to the page
    - Wherever this template is rendered, a JavaScript constants builder 
        will need to be used to render the constants file and then 
	add it to the template
